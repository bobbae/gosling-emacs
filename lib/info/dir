This is the file INFO;DIR >, which contains the topmost node of the
info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke INFO you start off
looking at that node ( "(INFO;DIR)Top" ).

File: DIR	Node: Top	This is the top of the tree

This is the Directory node of INFO.  The "D" command comes back here.
The directory is a list of all the major topics that INFO knows about.
You can see it, starting ten lines or so below this line.

If you need help in using INFO, "?" will get you a brief refresher
listing all the commands, and "H" will show you a primer.  If this is
your first use of INFO, you should definitely type "H".  To exit INFO
type "Q".

Everyone is encouraged and asked, urged and exhorted, implored and cajoled,
to add documentation to this tree. (Visit Menu item INFO for how).

* Menu: The "Menu" is the list of topics.  Here it is:

* General information programs::
;* Twenex::
* Text Editors::
* Formatting Systems for Text::
;* Programming Systems::     (a few, from MIT)
* Languages: (LANGUAGES).   (all you ever heard of, briefly)
;* Debugging facilities::
* Terminal Support::
* Miscellaneous Topics::
* Local: (local)Top	Information about local topics

General information programs:

* INFO:	(info)Top	INFO is this program.  Look here for how to
			add documentation to the tree.
  ^^ Notice that INFO is the topic, while (INFO)Top is the node name.

Twenex:

;* JSYS: (JSYS)		An online form of the monitor calls manual.

;* EXEC: (EXEC)		Documents all the EXEC commands, and how to invoke
			many utility programs such as compilers.

Text Editors:

* EMACS: (EMACS)Top	EMACS is an editor / collection of subsystems.

* TAGS: (TAGS)		TAGS, an EMACS library, remembers the location
			of every tag in one or more files, so you can
			go to any of them very quickly.

Formatting Systems for Text:

;* ATSIGN: (ATSIGN)	Generates program or text listings with
			cross references, table of contents, etc.

;* R: (RGUIDE)		A general, multi-font, multi-device, multi-system
;* RGUIDE: (RGUIDE)	text formatter, with many advanced features such
			as footnotes, table of contents, etc., available.
			Currently the most popular formatter in the LCS/AI
			community.  Runs on ITS, VAX, and UNIX, too.
			
;* RMAN: (DOC:R20.MANUAL)*
			The R reference manual.  You probably
			want the R GUIDE, instead.

;* ISPELL: (ISPELL)
			This is a program to check and correct spelling.
			It understands the syntax of source documents
			for the formatters TJ6, R, PUB, SCRIBE, and TEX.
			It is available (under the name SPELL) on ITS also.

Programming Systems:
(These entries are generally too large to be useful.  Perhaps they will
 be restructured someday...)

;* TECO: (TECORD.INFO)*
			An editing system in which higher level editor
			packages such as EMACS are written.

;* TECOA: (TECO ARCHIV)*
			A record of TECO updates.
;* MIDAS: (MIDAS)	The powerful assembly/macro language in which
			most machine language programs on ITS are
			written.

;* PALX: (PALX ORDER)*
			A cross assembler for PDP-11 assembly language.

Utilities:

;* SRCCOM: (SRCCOM)	A source-compare utility, with options for 
			manual or automatic merging.

Debugging facilities:

;* TDEBUG: (TDEBUG)Top
			TDEBUG provides a stepping facility for
			Teco macros.

Terminal Support:

;* Terminals: (TERMS)
			This is a description of various display
			terminals. 

;* ITSTTY: (ITSTTY)
			A description of the terminal subsystem of the
			ITS operating system.

Miscellaneous Topics:

;* XGP: (XGP)
			This is a description of the facilities
			of the XGP device, its spooler, and the
			XGP program, which is used to queue
			files for output on the XGP.
