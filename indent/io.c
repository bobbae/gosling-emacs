NAME:
	dump_line

FUNCTION:
	Does the actual printing of the stored up line

ALGORITHM:
	For each of the label, code, and comment sections which are used on 
	this line:

	1) Use pad_output to get the section aligned properly.
	2) write the section

	The indentation level used for the code is set by ind_level.  After
	printing, ind_level is set to i_l_follow.

	An extra level of indentation is added if ind_stmt is 1.  After 
	printing, ind_stmt is set to 1 iff the line just printed has an
	unterminated, non-declaration statement.

PARAMETERS:
	None

RETURNS:
	Nothing

GLOBALS:
	labbuf
	s_lab
	e_lab =		Reset to s_lab

	codebuf
	s_code
	e_code =	Reset to s_code

	combuf
	s_com
	e_com =		Reset to s_com

	bl_line =	Set to true iff the line was blank
	case_ind
	code_lines =	Count lines with code
	com_col
	com_lines =	Keep track of lines with comments
	decl_on_line =	Set to in_decl after line is printed
	i_l_follow
	in_decl
	in_stmt
	ind_level =	Set to i_l_follow at completion
	ind_size
	ind_stmt =	Set to in_stmt at completion if not in declaration
	out_lines =	Count output lines
	p_l_follow
	paren_level =	Set to p_l_follow at completion
	pcase
	use_ff =	Reset to false
