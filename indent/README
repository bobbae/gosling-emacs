This is the C indenter, it originally came from the University of Illinois
via some distribution tape for PDP-11 Unix.  It has subsequently been
hacked upon by James Gosling @ CMU.  It isn't very pretty, and really needs
to be completely redone, but it is probably the nicest C pretty printer
around.
