Installing Emacs is fairly simple:

1. The first step is to edit the site configuation file, config.h. The
comments in the file should tell you all that you need to know. The makefile
will need to be edited to change the installation directories and the
libraries to be used.

2. Compile Emacs and it's associated support programs (makemail,
getmail, updatemail, loadst, dbadd, dblist and dbprint) by invoking
"make" in the source directory.  There should be no error messages of
any sort.

3. Move the compiled version of Emacs (the file temacs) to wherever
users will be accessing it from: probably /bin or /usr/bin.

4. You may want to put the database manipulation programs (see the
documentation on them in dbadd.1) into the same directory as Emacs.
The programs are dbadd, dblist, dbprint and dbcreate.

5. Move all of the MLisp files from the maclib directory to the
directory named by PATH_LOADSEARCH in your edited configuation file.
It is essential that these files be accessible since several standard
Emacs commands have been moved from C to MLisp.

6. Some of the MLisp files will need to be edited to reflect the
directories in which databases are to be kept.  The files to edit
are:

	DesWord.ml	implements the describe-word-in-buffer
			command (^X^D)
	rmail.ml	the mail system
	info.ml		an ITS-like information system

7. Some of the MLisp files will need to be edited to reflect the
directories in which the executable assist programs are kept:

	rmail.ml	invokes collectmail and makemail
	time.ml		invokes loadst

8. DesWord and info use the "quickinfo" and "info" databases.
To create them chdir to the directory in which you want them to
reside (it should correspond to the changes you made in 6.  Then
create them with dbcreate ("dbcreate quickinfo; dbcreate info")
and execute the command files quickinfo.sh and info.sh to add
entries to the databases.
