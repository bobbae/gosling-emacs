    Well, we finally recovered from a bad disk failure.  Here's the
    version of Emacs that we're running now under 4.1a.  There are a
    couple of bugs:

    > Unexpected processes are handled via TCP sockets.  When you
    suspend emacs, the code tries to reset the socket (so others don't
    try to connect), but this doesn't work correctly all the time
    (something is very *screwy* in UNIX).

    > When you write a file that already exists, the group of the file
    reverts back to that of the directory that the file is in (the 4.1a
    way for creating *NEW* files).  This is because of the unlink(),
    link(), unlink() sequence followed by a creat().  This is annoying
    but not really serious.  (To fix it, you'd need to force emacs to
    copy in place instead of linking -- ala backup-by-copying --
    whenever the group id of the file differs from the group id of its
    directory.  Even then, you'd need to exec() a chgrp -- very messy!)

    Well, here's the code we're running now...
