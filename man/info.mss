@Section(info -- documentation reader)
@index(info)
@i[Info] is a system which lets you browse through the documentation for
various systems.  In particular, all the @Value(Emacs) documentation is
available online through it.  Both the @i[describe-command] and
@i[describe-variable] functions use it.

Rather than document @i[Info] extensivly here, I suggest that you run
@i[Info] and use it to describe itself.
